# C# Output

## C# Output

- to output vlaues, use `WriteLine()` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

- add as many `WriteLine()` methods as you want; notice it will add a new line for each method:

```c#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
```

You can also output numbers and perform mathematical calculations:
```c#
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
```

## The Write Method

- the `Write()` method is similar to `WriteLine()`, but it does **NOT** insert a new line at the end of output:

```c#
Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
```
