# C# Get Started

## C# IDE

- easiest way to get started with C# is with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- IDE is used to `edit` and `compile` code
- in this tutorial `Visual Studio Community` will be used, free to download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
- applications written in C# use the .NET Framework, so it makes sense to use Visual Studio, because: Visual Studio, .NET Framework and C# are ALL developed by Microsoft

## C# Install

- install Visual Studio Installer
- choose .NET workload and click on the `modify/install` button
- click `Launch` to get started
- start window > `Create a new project`
- `Install more tools and features` button > Console App (.NET Core)
- Enter name for your project > `Create` button
- Visual Studio automatically generates some code for you:

```c#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}
```
- run the program by pressing `F5`or `Debug` > `Start debugging` (this compiles and executes code)
- Congratulations! You've written and executed your first C# program
