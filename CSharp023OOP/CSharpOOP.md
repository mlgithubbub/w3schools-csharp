# C# OOP

## C# - What is OOP?

- OOP = Object-Oriented Programming
- procedural programming = writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data
- VS. object-oriented programming = creating objects that contain both data and methods

Advantages of OOP over procedural programming:
- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for programs
- OOP helps to keep the code `DRY` (Don't Repeat Yourself), makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create fully reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
- DRY principle is about reducing repetition of code: extract out common codes, put them in a single place and reuse them instead of repeating them

## C# - What are Classes and Objects?

- a `class` is a template for objects
- an `object` is an instance of a class
- when individual objects are created, they inherit all of the variables and methods from the class
